**Objectives** : 
Yesterday, we saw how to pre-process single cell rna seq (Chromium) to extract "high quality cells". Today we will explore further a similar dataset and use a computional approach called novoSparc to reconstruct the spatial transcriptome. Before performing an advanced technic such as spatial transcriptomics, it is good to have some kind of validation. So as the first step, we will visualize co-expressed genes in UMAP and see if we can find the same co-expression in our predicted spatial transcriptome. 


In this pratical session, you will learn : 

* how to visualize co-expressed genes in UMAP ;
* how to map dissociated single cells back to their tissue of origin using novoSpaRc (de novo Spatial Reconstruction of Single-Cell Gene Expression).

We will be using one of the dataset publilshied with Nitizan et al. The data are alreay filtered ("high quality cells") and log-normalized.

# Working in Python in RStudio
RStudio makes it easy to combine R and Python in a single data science project thanks to the package "reticulate". You just need to specify the language you want to use at the beginning of the chunk.


```{r setup}
library(reticulate) # to use Python through a R framework

# optional : check the version of Python that you are using (not useful for this workshop)
# use_python("/usr/local/bin/python3.6", required = TRUE) 
```
To import package from Python, the syntax is a but different:

```{python3, message = FALSE}
import numpy as np   # we use the alias np to call function from the package numpy
import novosparc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import anndata as an
```

Create a variable `x` in  Python :
```{python3, message=FALSE}
x = np.array([1,2,3])
print(x)
```
Use the variable x in R by adding *py$* in front of the variable name
```{r, message=FALSE}
py$x
```
You can also create a new variable `y` in the Python session using R, and pass a data frame to `y`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
py$y <- head(cars) # cars is a dataset which is pre-installed in R
```
Print the variable `y` in Python:
```{python3, message=FALSE, message = FALSE}
print(y)
```
# Basic vizualization
In this section, we will perfome some basic analyses of the dataset provided in Nitizan et al. using Seurat. 
We will group cells in clusters and visualise the group using UMAP. A quick analysis of the cluster to identfy

If you are not familiar with Seurat object and scRNAseq pre-processing, you can look at yesterday's tutorial, which is available on [github](https://github.com/PSL-winter-school-2021/01-monday-workshop-rna). 

## Import data in Seurat 

```{r, message=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(Seurat)
```

We import the log-normalized high quality cells as a dataframe and then convert the dataframe to a Seurat object. 
```{r}
log.nrmlz.matrix <- read.table("data/data_day2/drosophila_scRNAseq/dge_normalized.txt", sep='\t', row.names=1)
dim(log.nrmlz.matrix)
print(log.nrmlz.matrix[1:3,1:4])
```
We have 1963 genes and 1297 cells
```{r create-seurat-obj}
dataset <- CreateSeuratObject(counts =  log.nrmlz.matrix)
```
## A quick reminder on SeuratObject
In Seurat, data are organised in different compartements (slots), which contains them-selves several compartements, which can them-selves contain sub compartments...
```{r view-slotNames}
slotNames(dataset)
```

Each compartment can be used to store: 

* data from multiple modalities, such as RNAseq (slot `assays`, sub-slot `RNA`), ATAC-seqâ€¦ 
* results of analyses: dimension reduction, clustering ...
*...

You navigate through this hierarchy using `@` and `$` signs. 
```{r view-slotNames-assays}
slotNames(dataset@assays$RNA)
```

The structure of the Seurat object reflects the pre-processing steps. The scRNAseq workflow consists of 3 main steps :
* start with raw expression matrix (UMIs after sequencing) and filter out "low quality cells" : data are stored in the compartement `counts`; 
* log-normalize the data: to correct for sequencing biais : `data`
* perform a dimension reduction such as PCA to reduce the computation time and unnecessary information. PCA requires the data to normalized and scaled : `scale.data`. 
 
 
## Perform dimension reductions
When analysing scRNAseq data, you will usually perform some clustering to identify sub-populations and use some technique for visualization (e.g. UMAP). These analyses are performed on a lower dimensional space. Here we perform a PCA on the list of highly variable genes provided by the authors. 

```{r load-hvg}
list_hvg  = read.csv("data/data_day2/drosophila_scRNAseq/high_var_genes.txt", header=FALSE)

# the list of gene was imported as a dataframe, we can convert it to a list
dataset@assays$RNA@var.features  = as.list(list_hvg$V1)
```

```{r run-pca, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dataset <- ScaleData(dataset)
dataset <- RunPCA(dataset, features = list_hvg$V1)
```

```{r plot-pca}
DimPlot(dataset, reduction = "pca")
sum(dataset@reductions$pca@stdev[1:35])
```

```{r plot-umap}
nPC          = 35 # number of PC kept for the analysis
n.neighbours = 15
resol        = 0.4 # impact the number of clusters 
# k-nn graoh
dataset <- FindNeighbors(dataset, k.param = n.neighbours,dims = 1:nPC) 
# make the clusters
dataset <- FindClusters(dataset, resolution = resol) 
dataset <- RunUMAP(dataset, dims = 1:nPC)
DimPlot(dataset, reduction = "umap")
```

```{r plot-genes}
# Select other genes 
#FeaturePlot(object = dataset,
#            features = c('ftz','ImpE2','sim'),
#            cols = c("grey", "blue"),
#            reduction = "umap")

FeaturePlot(object = dataset,
            features = c('twi','zen','aay'),
            cols = c("grey", "blue"),
            reduction = "umap",
            pt.size = 0.2)
```


# Spatial transcriptome with novoSparc
## Import data 
novoSpaRc is an algorithm that  predicts the location of dissociated single cells. To work, the algorithm needs :

* the expression matrix of the single cells data
* the shape/geometry of the tissue of origin

The performance is greatly increased if you provide some marker genes (also called landmarks / atlas) for which the expression patterns are known.


### Single cells expression matrix
```{python3}
# Single data : expression matrix (already imported)
datafile_sc      ='data/data_day2/drosophila_scRNAseq/dge_normalized.txt'

# Optional : provide a list of highly variable genes (speed up the calculations if we only map a small number of genes)
datafile_sc_hvg  ='data/data_day2/drosophila_scRNAseq/high_var_genes.txt'
# Optional : geometry of the tissue
datafile_geom   ='data/data_day2/bdtnp/geometry.txt'
# Optional : Landamark genes = genes with known pattern of expression (eg. FISH image...)
datafile_atlas  ='data/data_day2/bdtnp/atlas.txt'
```
How to format the single cell matrix : 

* Novosparc expect a matrix with **genes in columns and cells in rows**. Be careful, this is not the usual order ! 
* {#Nitizan} and al. advised to use the **normalized gene expression matrix** (e.g. using the global scaling log-normalization method)
* The data need to be in the `Anndata format. Novosparc has a function to import an expression matrix and to convert it in the `Anndata` format (alternativaly you can convert a pandas dataframe to an `Anndata` easily).

```{python3}
import novosparc
dataset   = novosparc.io.load_data(datafile_sc)

dataset   = dataset.T  # in this example we have to tanspose the matrix to have gene in columns and cells in rows
print ('number of cells: ',dataset.shape[0],'\nnumber of genes: ', dataset.shape[1])
print("Gene names :", dataset.var.index.tolist()[:10])

# Alternative : convert a pandas dataframe to AnnData format
# data = pd.read_csv(data_path,sep='\t') 
# dataset = sc.AnnData(data )
# dataset = dataset2.T 
```
To save computation time, we will only map a subset of the genes. Here we will focus on a list of highly variable genes provided with the publication.
```{python3}
hvg           = np.genfromtxt(datafile_sc_hvg, dtype='str')

dataset,hvg   = novosparc.pp.subset_to_hvg(dataset, gene_list = hvg )

dataset.shape
```
## Create the geometry of your tissue (*target space*)

You need to create the grid that describes the shape of your tissue (location of the cells in the tissue). 

You have 3 options :

* either 1) you know the cellular locations and have them in a file ;
* either 2) you don't know the cellular locations, but you know the shape of your tissue;
* either 3) you know nothing and will just assume that your tissue is a rectangle.

### case 1 : you know the cellular locations 
We suppose that you have a file that contain the XYZ location of each cells in your tissue. 

Note : if your tissue is flat, you can set the Z-coordinate to 1.

```{python3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read and use the bdtnp geometry
#locations = np.loadtxt(datafile_geom, usecols=range(3), skiprows=1)
locations = novosparc.io.load_target_space(datafile_geom, is_2D=True)
locations = locations[:3039, :] # we are just focusing on the first 3039 positions
print("Number of location in the tissue ",locations.shape[0])
print(locations[0:5,:])
```
Each line in the geometry file gives you the XYZ coordinate of a cell.
```{python3}
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], s=1)
plt.show()
plt.close()

```
We can visualize all the position for which $Z=1$
```{python3}
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], s=1)
plt.show()
plt.close()

```
### Alternative tissue spaces
If you do not know the cellular locations of your tissue, you can create them. novoSpaRc has  two functions that enable to construct them quickly.
#### case 2: you know the shape of your tissue
he function *create_target_space_from_image* creates a target space by using a user-generated image. The image has to be a black shape drawn onto a white background. You can do it in Fiji for instance.
```{python3}
tissue_path = 'data/data_day2/tissue_example.png'
locations2   = novosparc.geometry.create_target_space_from_image(tissue_path)
print(locations2[:3,])
```
This creates a very large number of locations, so it is better to subsample them.
```{python3}
print ('dimension of original tissue space:', locations2.shape)
locations2     = locations2[np.random.choice(locations2.shape[0], 2000), :]
print ('dimension of downsampled tissue space:', locations2.shape[0])
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(locations2[:, 0], locations2[:, 1],s=1)
plt.show()
plt.close()
```
#### case 3 : you assume that your tissue is a rectangle
The function *construct_target_grid* can be used to construct a basic rectangular grid as target space. The only parameter is the total number of cellular locations on the target grid.
```{python3}
locations3 = novosparc.geometry.construct_target_grid(500)
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(locations3[:, 0], locations3[:, 1], s=1)
plt.show()
plt.close()
```

# 3. Predict the spatial transcriptome

## Predict the spatial transcriptome (without landmark genes)

Once you have defined the cellular locations, you can create a "tissue" object that will contain the predicted spatial transcriptome.
```{python3}
# create a tissue object, the results will be saved in the directory "outputs"
tissue = novosparc.cm.Tissue(dataset=dataset, locations=locations, output_folder='outputs') 

```
**Principle of novosparc reconstruction** (if no landmarks genes are provided) : 

1. Construct a k-nearest neighbors (knn) graph 

    * for the physical space (cellular location) : calculate the (euclidian) distance matrix between the  locations, then for each location only keep the k-nearest neighbours (the value k is set by *num_neighbors_s*). 
    * for the expression space (single cells) : calculate the distance (correlation)  matrix between the  each cells, then for each location only keep the k-nearest neighbours (the value k is set by *num_neighbors_t*)

2. Computes the shortest path lengths for each pair of cells, this step results in graph-based distance matrices for cells and for locations. 

3) Match the N single cells to the M positions using these graphs: the algorithm try to minimize the discrepancy between the pair-wise graph-based distances in expression space and in physical space
```{python3}
tissue.setup_reconstruction(num_neighbors_s = 5, num_neighbors_t = 5)   # compute the knn graphs                         
```
Now we can reconstruct our tissue. The alpha_linear parameter controls the contribution of the two branches in novoSpaRc: alpha_linear=0 means that no prior information is available
```{python3}
tissue.reconstruct(alpha_linear=0, epsilon=5e-3)

```
We store the spatial gene expression matrix (sDGE) for the highly variable genes across all locations in a new variable
```{python3}
sdge_hvg = tissue.sdge
```
Plot the predicted patterns
```{python3}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
plt.subplot(231)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'ftz')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.subplot(232)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'twi')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.subplot(233)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'zen')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.subplot(234)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'ImpE2')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.subplot(235)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'sim')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.subplot(236)
plt.scatter(locations[:, 0], locations[:, 1], c=sdge_hvg[np.argwhere(hvg == 'pyr')[0], :].flatten(), s=1)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
plt.close()
```
This reconstruction has been realised without priori information. We can greatly improve the prediction by adding landmark genes
## Predict the spatial transcriptome (with landmark genes)
### Import landmark genes
```{python3}
insitu_genes = np.genfromtxt(datafile_atlas, usecols=range(84), dtype='str', max_rows=1)
atlas_matrix = np.loadtxt(datafile_atlas, usecols=range(84), skiprows=1)

```

```{python3}
# je prends seulement 3 genes
# faudrait filter les colonnes de atlas_matrix pour ietre sure que les noms
# de genes sont les memes que ceux dans single cells
insitu_genes = insitu_genes[2:5]
atlas_matrix = atlas_matrix[:,2:5]
```

On cherche les colonnes dans les donnÃ©es single cells qui matchent
```{python3}
gene_names = tissue_with_markers.gene_names
markers_in_sc = np.array([], dtype='int') # indice marker dans table sc

for marker in insitu_genes:
    marker_index = np.where(gene_names == marker)[0]
    if len(marker_index) > 0:
        markers_in_sc = np.append(markers_in_sc, marker_index[0])

print(markers_in_sc.shape )
print(gene_names[markers_in_sc])
```    
We are going to create a new tissue object and specify the markers to use

```{python3}
# contrairement au tutoriel, je ne pense pas qu'on doivent specifier la
# amtrice de marker quand on crÃ©e l'ebjet tissue
tissue_with_markers = novosparc.cm.Tissue(dataset=dataset, locations=locations)

tissue_with_markers.setup_reconstruction(markers_to_use=markers_in_sc, insitu_matrix=atlas_matrix,num_neighbors_s = 5, num_neighbors_t = 5)   # compute the knn graphs                         



```
alpha_linear = 0.5

```{python3}
alpha_linear = 0.5
tissue_with_markers.reconstruct(alpha_linear=0.5, epsilon=5e-3)
```


```{python3}
sdge_hvg2 = tissue_with_markers.sdge 
```
